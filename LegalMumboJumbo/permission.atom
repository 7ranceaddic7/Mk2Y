Greetings.

I am asking for your permission to update / continue / adopt / release the above named mod(s).

Hopefully I hear back from you with an answer, but in case I don't I intend to respectfully proceed as soon as the end of Oct 2019, as permitted by the individual license(s).

If you do agree, would you be so kind as to post as much in the mod's thread, and grant me access to updating/editing these mods on Spacedock (additional Authors). Would also like any unfinished parts, 3D models, and Unity assets so can include them on github.

Thank you.
